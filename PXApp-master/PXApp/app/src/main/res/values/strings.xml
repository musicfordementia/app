        To develop a plan for future music use with each patient consider the following questions based on the data recorded in the Listening Diary:\n\n
        1. Which particular songs were useful for reducing agitation?\n\n
        2. Which particular songs were useful for increasing alertness?\n\n
        3. Which songs were useful for distracting the person or managing difficult behaviour?\n\n
        4. Which songs were useful for cheering the person up?\n\n
        5. Which songs were useful for helping the person to sleep?\n\n
        6. Which songs resulted in negative reactions? Have these been deleted from the playlists?\n\n
        7. Which times of day was it most useful to play music to this person and which playlist was used at these times?\n\n
        8. Which listening situation was most comfortable for the person? (E.g. did they prefer to listen without headphones, and in a solitary place?)\n\n
        9. On average, how long did the person listen before losing interest?\n\n
        10. How often during a 1-week period was this person able to listen to the same playlist before it lost its effect?
