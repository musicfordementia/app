text|These guidelines are designed to be used by both home-based carers and care staff in residential aged care homes. The next section contains a brief step-by-step outline of the approach we recommend. However, we also suggest that you read the information accompanying each step so that you understand the processes involved, and use the tools contained at the end of these guidelines to help you monitor and plan how you will use music for each individual in your care.

There are several things that need to be taken into account when selecting music for people with dementia. These include:
•	The key challenges to care that the caregiver wants to address
•	The person’s tastes and preferences
•	The person’s mental health history and current symptoms
•	Features of the music itself
•	The time of day and frequency with which the music will be played
