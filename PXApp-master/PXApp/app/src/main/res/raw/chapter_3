text|Music can be used for more than just entertainment for people with dementia as it can provide a useful first line treatment for some of the key challenges to care.

There are four main ways that music can provide therapeutic benefits to people with dementia:
• By reducing or increasing arousal or alertness levels.
• By distracting individuals during challenging activities or times of the day.
• By helping them reconnect with personal memories.
• By providing mental stimulation.

Some of the key challenges to care that music can help to manage include:
• Agitation or anxiety
• Withdrawal or apathy
• Reduced verbal or social engagement
• Resistance to care situations such as showering, dressing or eating
• Restlessness, wandering, or falls • Sleep disturbances

Appendix 2 can be used as a template for determining the key challenges to care for each individual. It is recommended that separate playlists be created to address these different challenges.

If someone is apathetic or sad and withdrawn this is a relatively low arousal and negative state. In this case, music should be of moderate tempo in order to increase arousal levels, while taking care not to make the music too fast since this can cause arousal increases to an uncomfortable level.

In fact, it may be useful to have several playlists for a particular person, depending on the key challenges to care that you have identified for them. For example, a person may be withdrawn and apathetic at times, but agitated and anxious at other times. Different playlists would thus be used depending on the symptoms of the person for which the music is being used. Music can also be used to reduce restlessness and wandering by providing them with an interesting distraction and reducing arousal levels at a time when they might usually start to feel anxious. Falls can sometimes be reduced when the individual is distracted from wandering at key times of the day when they may usually become restless. Similarly, if the individual tends to become agitated during particular care routines such as showering or dressing, music can provide a useful distraction at this time. In such situations the tempo is not so important, as long as the music is enjoyable to the individual.

Similarly, where individuals are becoming less verbal and engaging in social interaction less frequently, music can help to reconnect the individual with personal memories that stimulate increased sharing with the caregiver.

The VNADS (Appendix 1) can help assess some of the challenges to care which could be the focus of playlist creation. For example, if a person’s highest scores are on items 4-7, a playlist designed to lower arousal levels and reduce agitation should be devised. On the other hand, if the person shows high levels of apathy as indicated by high scores on item 1, a playlist designed to increase arousal to a moderate level should be selected. Where scores on several subscales are high, multiple playlists may be required. In addition to the use of the VNADS the Challenges to Care assessment (Appendix 2) can be used to determine which symptoms playlists could be used to address.
