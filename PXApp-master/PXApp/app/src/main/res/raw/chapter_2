text|One of the primary ways in which music influences our mood is by its effect on arousal levels, or how sleepy or alert a person feels.  Emotions and moods are often categorised according to two dimensions: (i) arousal (activation or energy), and (ii) pleasantness. Figure 1 shows how several common emotions are understood on the basis of this model. For example, happiness is generally a relatively high-energy, pleasant emotion. Excitement is also a pleasant emotion but is higher in energy or arousal, while peacefulness is similarly pleasant but is low energy. Negative emotions can be high or low energy as well, with sadness being a low energy emotion and anger being a high energy emotion.

text|In general, most people function best when they are at a moderate level of arousal – neither under-stimulated or over-stimulated - and are experiencing positive emotions. Therefore, it is helpful to think about the symptoms that the person with dementia is experiencing and where they sit in this model so that you can determine in which direction you would like to change their current state. For example, someone who is agitated or anxious is experiencing a high arousal negative emotion. The aim of the music selection should be to lower arousal levels and to change their experience to a pleasant one. Therefore, music with slower tempos can be useful to lower the person’s arousal levels.
