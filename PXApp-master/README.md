# Songs System
## Musical Features
### Tempo
* Pace of song measured in beats per minute (BPM)
* Older adults prefer a slow to moderate tempo (80 BPM - 120 BPM)
* High tempo songs can increase agitation and anxiety
### Mode
* Key the song is written in
* Minor is associated with negative emotions like sadness
* Major is associated with positive emotions like happiness
## "Reminiscence Bump"
* Songs that were popular when user was 15 years old to 30 years old
* Non-english speaking users may benefit from songs from their region
## Reactions
### Positive Reactions
* Tapping foot/hand in sync with song
* Nodding
* Singing
* Humming
### Negative Reactions
* Crying
* Distressed vocalisations or facial expressions
* Restlessness
* Shallow breathing
## Mood/Emotions
* Two dimensions: arousal (activation or energy) and pleasantness
* Happiness is relatively high energy and pleasant emotion
* Excitement is also a pleasant emotion but even higher energy
* Agitation/anxiousness is a sign of a high energy and unpleasant emotion
  * Aim to lower arousal and change emotion to pleasant by playing songs with a slow tempo and major mode
## Time of Day
* Some people may need songs to increase their arousal if they tend to be sleepy/withdrawn in the mornings
* Some people experience "sundowners syndrome" where they feel depressed, fearful or agitated in the late afternoon or early evening
  * E.g. If someone usually gets agitated at 4pm, play a slow and calming song at 3:30pm
* Some people may have trouble sleeping so a playlist to help will be beneficial
## Dosage
* Enjoyment increases according to how familiar the listener is
* Listening to the same songs can cause them to not enjoy the song as much
* Monitor and record response using a diary (appendix 5)
* Rotate playlists for people with low saturation points (easily bored with listening to the same songs)
